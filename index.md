### Taking a picture using the PiCamera

A picture of the temperature display is taken and the saved in the directory /home/pi/Pictures/server under the name image.jpg.
The picture is saved only when the lights aren't switched on in the server room.
This code on Github can be found [here](https://github.com/shwetha1607/Server-temp/blob/Version-1.1/stillpic.py)

```markdown
# stillpic.py
```

```python
from picamera import PiCamera
from picamera.array import PiRGBArray
import time
import cv2

camera= PiCamera()
camera.resolution = (640, 480)
rawCapture = PiRGBArray(camera, size=(640,480))

time.sleep(5)
#camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/image.jpg')
camera.capture(rawCapture,format='bgr')
image = rawCapture.array

#at_time = time.strftime("%d%m%Y-%H%M%S", time.localtime())
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
blur = cv2.blur(gray, (5, 5))

if cv2.mean(blur)[0] < 3.0:
	cv2.imwrite('/home/pi/Pictures/server/image.jpg', image)
else:
	#print('lights on')
	pass
```

### Detection of temperature using Computer Vision

This follwing piece of code detects the temperature from the picture taken. OpenCV with Python is used.

```python
if isAwesome==0:
  print("Works")

```
